# README


* Description : This is a SinglePageApp that constantly communicates with a Block Chain API https://www.blockchain.com/api/blockchain_api, this app allows us the users to add, delete, and read about the block hash information we put in without fully reloading the page. To achieve this, I use HotWire from Ruby on Rails making the page not fully load when an action is submitted in this we are using Turbo Streams as a core weapon to achieve this.

* Heroku Link : https://serene-thicket-74491.herokuapp.com

* Usage : Grab a blockhash from the API like '0000000000000bae09a7a393a8acded75aa67e46cb81f7acaa5ad94f9eacd103' and start playing with the app.
